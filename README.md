# Gif Music Television

With the advent of (Giphy TV)[http://tv.giphy.com/] and (Tumblr TV)[https://www.tumblr.com/tv] watching Gifs mindlessly has proven to be something that is very captivating. My tenure at Tumblr led me to a lot of insights about why and how people use Gifs. Long story short, they are even more enjoyable when paired with other content. So I give you Gif Music Television, an easy way for people to pair up Gifs and Music. Just plug in a Youtube Playlist and a Gif theme and you are set. Simple, easy, powered by Youtube & Giphy.
